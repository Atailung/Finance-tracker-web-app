# ðŸš€ Dockerized Next.js App (Dev Mode)

A minimal setup to run a Next.js app in Docker, **with hot reload**, and **source code outside the container**.

### **Step 3: Start Container & Create Next.js App**

From the root of the project:

```bash
docker compose run nextjs npx create-next-app@latest . --no-eslint --no-tailwind --app
````

This installs a new Next.js app into your local folder.

### **Step 4: Install Dependencies**

Rebuild the container after scaffolding:

```bash
docker compose build
```

Or to ensure `node_modules` are correctly installed:

```bash
docker compose run nextjs npm install
```

---

### **Step 5: Start the App**

Start the container in dev mode:

```bash
docker compose up
```

Open in browser: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
